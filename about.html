        <h1>The Menu of Money</h1>
        
        <p>Look, I get it. You corner me at the family barbecue, slide up next to me at the coffee shop, or send me that inevitable text: <strong>"Hey, what should I invest in?"</strong></p>
        
        <p>And every single time, I want to give you the real answer – not some generic "buy index funds" response (though honestly, that's not terrible advice). The real answer is: <strong>there are about a million things you can invest in.</strong></p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "Asking 'what should I invest in?' is like walking into a restaurant and asking 'what should I eat?' Well... what are you hungry for? What's your budget? Are you allergic to anything? Do you want a quick snack or a five-course meal?"
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>This Is Your Menu</h2>
        
        <p>That's exactly what this catalog is – <strong>the menu for your money</strong>. Every investment vehicle known to humanity, laid out like dishes at your favorite restaurant. Stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto, hedge funds, your buddy's startup, art, wine, farmland, music royalties – it's all here.</p>
        
        <p>Because here's the thing: before you can decide what to order, you need to know what's available. Most people only know about the "appetizers" (stocks and bonds) and completely miss the fact that there's an entire steakhouse menu of opportunities.</p>
        
        <h2>But First, Know Yourself</h2>
        
        <p>Before you start clicking around and getting excited about Bitcoin mining or angel investing, you need to be honest about a few things:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How much can you actually afford to lose?</strong> I'm not being dramatic – every investment carries risk. That $10,000 you're thinking about investing... would losing it keep you up at night or just be annoying?</li>
            
            <li><strong>When do you need this money back?</strong> Next year? In 10 years? Never? This changes everything. You can't put your house down payment into a 7-year private equity fund.</li>
            
            <li><strong>How quickly do you need to access your money?</strong> Some investments are like your savings account – get your money anytime. Others are like Hotel California – you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave.</li>
            
            <li><strong>How much do you want to be involved?</strong> Do you want to set it and forget it, or do you want to actively manage, research, and tinker? Be honest – there's no wrong answer.</li>
            
            <li><strong>How much money are we talking about?</strong> Some investments have minimums. You can't angel invest with $100, and you probably shouldn't buy individual stocks with $10 million.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>The Real Talk</h2>
        
        <p>Here's what I wish someone had told me when I started: <strong>there's no perfect investment</strong>. Every single option in this catalog has trade-offs. Higher returns usually mean higher risk. Lower risk usually means lower returns. High liquidity often means giving up some upside. It's always a menu of compromises.</p>
        
        <p>The trick isn't finding the "best" investment – it's finding the ones that match your situation, goals, and honestly, your personality. Some people love the thrill of day trading. Others sleep better with boring bonds. Neither is wrong.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            "Diversification is the only free lunch in finance." – Harry Markowitz (the only finance quote you actually need to know)
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>How to Use This Thing</h2>
        
        <p>Think of this catalog as your research starting point, not your final answer. Click around, read about stuff you've never heard of, get curious. But then – and this is crucial – <strong>do your own homework</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>Every investment here comes with expected returns, risk levels, liquidity info, and minimum amounts. Use the filters to narrow down what makes sense for your situation. Found something interesting? Great! Now go research the hell out of it before you put real money in.</p>
        
        <p>And remember: you don't have to pick just one. Most smart investors spread their money across multiple types of investments. It's like ordering from different sections of the menu – appetizer, main course, and dessert.</p>
        
        <h2>A Final Word</h2>
        
        <p>I built this because I got tired of giving the same answer to the same question. Now when someone asks me "what should I invest in?", I can send them here and say: <strong>"Here's everything. Pick what matches your situation, do your research, and maybe talk to a real financial advisor if you're dealing with serious money."</strong></p>
        
        <p>The investment world doesn't have to be this mysterious, gatekept thing. It's just a really big menu. And now you have it.</p>
        
        <p>Go forth and invest wisely (or at least informedly).</p>
